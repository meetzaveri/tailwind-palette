### Why Tailwind Palette?

Okay, what if you can test your color palette with color filled cards and contrasting text filled in so that you can figure which color(s) suits to your design components? Yes, that's already in this tool. I've taken this idea from Atlassian color guide, where they let you preview color shades with contrasting text and how they look together

With this comes, auto-generated tailwind config(JSON) which you can basically copy and paste it into your tailwind.config.js file. You can toggle settings on and off for including dark and light themes in config
